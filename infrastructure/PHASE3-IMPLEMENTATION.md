# Phase 3: Document Management System - Implementation Complete

## Overview

Phase 3 has been successfully implemented with the following components:

### Subphase 3.1: Direct S3 Upload Implementation ✅
- **File Upload Component**: Complete with drag-and-drop, progress tracking
- **Multipart Upload**: Implemented for files >5MB with progress callbacks
- **S3 Service**: Full CRUD operations with user isolation
- **Metadata System**: Document metadata storage in DynamoDB
- **Security**: User-scoped permissions and access controls

### Subphase 3.2: Document Processing Pipeline ✅
- **Lambda Functions**: Document processor with AWS Textract integration
- **Processing Pipeline**: Automatic text extraction and metadata storage
- **Status Tracking**: Real-time processing status (pending, processing, completed, failed)
- **Dead Letter Queue**: Error handling for failed processing
- **S3 Integration**: Processed documents stored in dedicated bucket

## Implementation Details

### Infrastructure Components

1. **DataStack** (`lib/stacks/data-stack.ts`)
   - Added `processedDocumentsBucket` for storing processed documents
   - Configured with KMS encryption and lifecycle policies

2. **ProcessingStack** (`lib/stacks/processing-stack.ts`)
   - Document processor Lambda with Textract permissions
   - DLQ handler Lambda for error processing
   - IAM policies for S3 and DynamoDB access

3. **Lambda Functions**
   - `document-processor/index.ts`: Main processing logic with Textract
   - `processing-dlq/index.ts`: Dead letter queue handler

### Frontend Components

1. **S3Service** (`app/lib/services/s3-service.ts`)
   - Multipart upload implementation
   - Progress tracking callbacks
   - Document CRUD operations
   - User isolation patterns

2. **DynamoDBService** (`app/lib/services/dynamodb-service.ts`)
   - Document metadata management
   - Status tracking operations
   - Search and filter capabilities

3. **FileUpload Component** (`app/components/FileUpload.tsx`)
   - Drag and drop interface
   - Upload progress display
   - File type validation

4. **Documents Page** (`app/dashboard/documents/page.tsx`)
   - Complete document management UI
   - Status indicators and filtering
   - Search functionality

## Post-Deployment Configuration Required

### S3 Event Notifications
Due to CDK cyclic dependency limitations, S3 event notifications must be configured after deployment:

```bash
cd infrastructure/post-deployment
./configure-s3-notifications.sh [stage] [region]
```

This script:
1. Retrieves bucket and Lambda ARN from CloudFormation outputs
2. Configures S3 event notifications for document types (.pdf, .doc, .docx, .txt)
3. Sets up automatic processing triggers

### Manual Configuration (Alternative)
If the script fails, configure manually via AWS Console:
1. Go to S3 bucket → Properties → Event notifications
2. Create notification for "All object create events"
3. Set prefix filter: `users/`
4. Set suffix filters: `.pdf`, `.doc`, `.docx`, `.txt`
5. Select Lambda destination: `StrataGPT-document-processor-{stage}`

## Test Status

### Component Tests ✅
All Phase 3 component tests pass:
- S3 service implementation
- DynamoDB service methods
- FileUpload component
- Documents page UI
- AWS configuration

### Integration Tests ⚠️
Integration tests require AWS credentials and should be run in a test environment:
- Document upload lifecycle
- Processing pipeline
- Status tracking
- Security permissions

## Original Phase 3 Requirements Compliance

✅ **Direct S3 Upload Implementation**
- File upload component with progress tracking
- Multipart upload for large files
- Document metadata system

✅ **Document Processing Pipeline**  
- S3 event triggers (configured post-deployment)
- Lambda text extraction with Textract
- DynamoDB metadata storage
- Processing status tracking

✅ **User Data Isolation**
- All documents scoped to user identity
- IAM policies enforce access controls
- S3 key patterns include user ID

✅ **Error Handling**
- Dead Letter Queue for failed processing
- Status tracking for all document states
- Comprehensive error logging

## Deployment Commands

```bash
# Infrastructure deployment
cd infrastructure
npm run deploy

# Post-deployment S3 configuration
cd post-deployment
./configure-s3-notifications.sh dev us-east-1

# Frontend deployment
cd ../frontend
npm run build
```

## Verification

After deployment and S3 configuration:

1. **Upload Test**: Upload a PDF through the UI
2. **Processing Verification**: Check document status changes from "pending" to "processing" to "completed"
3. **Text Extraction**: Verify extracted text appears in DynamoDB
4. **Error Handling**: Upload an invalid file to test error states

## Architecture Notes

- **Cyclic Dependency Resolution**: S3 event notifications moved to post-deployment to avoid CDK cyclic dependencies
- **Multipart Upload**: Automatically used for files >5MB with configurable threshold
- **User Isolation**: All S3 keys follow pattern `users/{identityId}/documents/{filename}`
- **Processing Pipeline**: Asynchronous with status tracking and error handling

Phase 3 implementation is complete and ready for production deployment with the post-deployment configuration step.
